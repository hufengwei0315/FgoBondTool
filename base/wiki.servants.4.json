Hell, you're even a Caster!!\"\n\n\nThus, the fate of these two were firmly interlocked, and as a result, they eventually became friends.\n\n\n\"How about the left half is mine, and the right half is yours, what do you think about that?\" (Anastasia)\n\n\"Sounds good to me!\" (Corday)\n\n\n\"This is not good at all\", \"this is really bad,\" they would yell as they were being chased by the Chaldean police, but for now this was something to come much later on."]

Kama is now motivated. She dressed in a cute swimsuit and shifted to a more proactive approach to corrupting her Master.\n\n\n\"How do you like this? It's the true form of Mara, Demon King of the Summer. Is it scary how you can get corrupted whenever you lower your guard?\"\n\n\nEveryone exchanged nods, agreeing that the scary part is how Kama doesn't seem any different from her usual self."],

She still doesn't feel like taking \"love or whatever her job was\" seriously, but being belittled is still irritating regardless.\n\n\n\"Parvati used to be so cautious around me, but now all I see in her eyes is 'pull your pranks in moderation, ok?'. How am I supposed to pester her if she won't seriously fear and be wary of me...?\"\n\n\nTherefore, she made her decision. This is where she'll aim for the home run. Change her name tag from the god of love to the Demon King of corruption and display her presence for everyone to see.\n\nAnd then came the summer, her perfect chance.\n\n\n\"I'll take this nice opportunity and do my best to corrupt Master. I mean, just look at me. Who wouldn't be corrupted if I acted all lovey-dovey (lol) to them in a swimsuit? And... I'll take my earnest revenge! Parvati and all of her cronies who aren't taking me seriously, you'll pay for the humiliation I got from your lukewarm eyes telling me I mellowed out!

Makara is also the vahana (mount) of the water god Varuna and the Ganges goddess Ganga, which means it has the power to control water. The strange float her summer version is always riding, shaped like a shark or an alligator, can cross the stormy seas and sometimes show better mobility than a water scooter, all with visual effects that make her look like she's floating comfortably on a calm pool.\n\n\n•Midsummer Beach Mara: EX\n\nThe Skill that represents how motivated the Demon King of Summer is. It can be considered a summer version of Mara Papiyas. It reduces her lethargic downer side, making her more active, even if not by much. If you ask her to do something she'd normally be too lazy to accept, you might get a \"Sure, why not? It's summer.\" instead of her rejecting glare."],

It's no exaggeration to say it is a weapon that makes people fall in love just by looking at it. Whenever this Noble Phantasm lands a hit, Corruption Power pours out of it in the shape of a shadow giant. Kama herself is not sure why they look like that.

The meaning of this universe is the same it always has been, but due to the unique traits of her current Saint Graph, it manifests as something deeper and more hollow. It's impossible for anyone who fell here to escape. This space can be considered a hollow cavity transformed into flame.

She's just Kama getting more active on her attempts to seduce her Master because that's how things go on summer.\n\n\nIf anything, forcing herself too much on the offensive made her defensively weak. In other words, she's doesn't think things through. She offers a drink for them to share on a couple's straw, but when it's time to actually drink it, she gets all red and palpitating. That's why Parvati is not regarding her as very dangerous. Because it's obvious to her that Kama will fall for her own traps and utterly fail to one-sidedly corrupt them.\n\n\nBut despite this summer Saint Graph, the fact remains that this Servant is Kama and Mara. The Kama/Mara proportion is 6:4 normally and 4:6 as Beast. And, shocking news, the current proportion is...!\n\n\nShe seems to think it's around 3:7, it actually haven't changed at all, you see?

She used her Imperial Priledge to devise her Imperial Tao Arts (Zetian-original Tao Arts fine-tuned to steamroll the dead. She took most tips from jiangshi movies.). And so she started treating her familiar-like enforcers as jiangshi.\n\n\nShe is in the best of moods for having conquered one of her weaknesses. With techniques to counter departed souls, Wu Zetian started spending her days with the ghosts under her whip, as if in retaliation for all she had been through before...\n\n\nIs she really over her fear...?

Cats still glared at her with spiteful eyes. She couldn't use spells that she knew didn't work. To stabilize her Swimsuit Saint Graph, her Class needed to be converted to Caster, but due to that past, this was difficult. As such, Skadi used her runes to seal the memory of how the Tao Arts she learned were useless.\n\n\nBy believing in her own Tao magecraft, Wu Zetian could transform into her Swimsuit Saint Graph and seemingly forget her fear of ghosts. She is simply in the mindset of \"they're not scary because I can beat them\". Her summertime dream will end either when the end of summer makes her remember how her magecraft was useless, or when she meets a ghost with valid reasons to haunt her, which her Saint Graph can't exorcise because she'll get thinking that her Tao Art might fail (since the ghost is the one in the right).\n\n\nYes... After everything she tried, at her core, she still believes even now that all the political enemies she assassinated to take over the country have all the right to direct their grudges and resentments at her, and that spirits will inevitably curse her. But this sensation comes from her pride telling her that she's not too weak to handle it and that she doesn't regret usurping the throne. Naturally, being the hard worker that she is, she continued looking for a way to overcome her fear of spirits (and cats) after the summer was over."]

The nameless monk of peasant upbringing preached theology to the people, gathered followers, and eventually gained the Tsar's trust, making him a major figure in the state's dissolution. He was the subject of much gossip, plausible or otherwise, and later generations came to know him as the Mad Monk due to the mysterious miracles he performed.\n\nHe deepened his amity with the Russian imperial family when he saved Tsar Nikolai II's son and heir Tsarevich Alexei from illness, earning him great political influence, which caused him to be shunned by the nobility. His upbringing and uninhibited companionship with his female followers caused the orthodox clergy to disregard him as heretic and immoral, and popular rumors told that he was using the Tsar as a puppet for his interests. Rasputin lived with many enemies but never ever changed his beliefs and behaviors.\n\n\nRasputin was even considered one of the causes of Imperial Russia's collapse, but in reality, he strongly advocated for a pacific resolution to the battle against Germany shortly before World War I. He remained a pacifist afterward, making him an obstacle to the people wishing for war in both countries. Also, Rasputin was a lecher, but rather than living in luxury, he made a point to always live a frugal life.\n\nOn December 17th, 1916, he was assassinated by the military and nobility lamenting the future of Imperial Russia. During the assassination, he wouldn't die from eating a meal laced with potassium cyanide, forcing the killer to change the cause of death to a revolver shot. He still wouldn't die from 2 bullets, one to the heart and one to the lung, so after more fire, they finally confirmed his death. Afterward, they threw his body off the Petrovsky Bridge.

As a survivor of the Fourth Holy Grail War, he inherited the role of overseer. He was a qualified Executor and skilled in mediunic cure.

    "2": ["He was born into the Takasugi clan, a prestigious family that had served the Mōri clan for generations since the Sengoku era.\n\n\nAt first he attended Meirinkan, a feudal domain school, but he found their practices of allowing only samurai to attend, stiff formal lessons, among many others, so utterly archaic that he enrolled into Shōka Sonjuku, an academy taken over by Yoshida Shōin, a previous top student at Meirinkan.\n\n\nUnlike Meirinkan, he found Shōka Sonjuku, or rather Shōin's classes, stupidly interesting, and he quickly rose to prominence as Shōin's disciple. He also went to Edo to study abroad, but his teacher, Yoshida Shōin, was captured and executed due to the Ansei Purge. This is when he began to openly speak of overthrowing the shogunate.\n\n\nFollowing these events, Takasugi joined a delegation under the shogunate and studied in Shanghai. Witnessing the threat posed by the Western powers, he grew even more concerned about the future of Japan and the overthrowing of the shogunate.\n\n\nAfter returning to Japan, he joined the Sonnō Jōi movement and mingled with samurai from various clans in Edo and Kyoto. But even amongst these samurai, Takasugi was an exceptionally unconventional man with numerous radical acts such as setting the British legation on fire.\n\n\nThe Chōshū domain tried to keep Takasugi obedient by assigning him to a position, but he immediately turned it down. He continued to be nonsensical, saying that he would fool around for a decade and shave his head. He also stated he would go somewhere far away, but he ended up playing his shamisen and composing songs in his hometown.\n\n\nChōshū bombarded the Americans, French and Dutch in Shimonoseki, and promptly got pummeled by them. Frightened by this outcome, Chōshū entrusted Takasugi with defending Shimonoseki. As a result, Takasugi established the \"Kiheitai\", a modernized militia not bound by social status. However, following some disputes, he was soon dismissed as the leader of the Kiheitai. \"Damn clansmen, complaining over the littlest things.\"\n\n\nAnyhow, after this and that, Chōshū became the enemy of the imperial government after the Hamaguri Rebellion, and they continued to be bombarded by the combined naval forces of four nations in Shimonoseki. \"It's over now!\" they thought, but for some reason the Chōshū clan once again asked Takasugi, who was imprisoned at the time, to negotiate a peace agreement. However, Takasugi was only too eager to sabotage this peace conference, and he developed an Ultra C plan to force the shogunate to pay reparations instead. At the meeting, Takasugi put up a show by suddenly reciting the Kojiki and even pretending not to hear about the concession of Hikoshima.\n\n\nWhile all of this was going on, the First Chōshū expedition was approaching, and a faction of the Chōshū clan loyal to the shogunate emerged to try to accept the shogunate's demands. Takasugi was so enraged by this that he commanded a troop with a miniscule number of men at Kōzanji. As reckless as his decision was to command a troop, Takasugi and his men in a state of maximum tension, marched into Hagi and wiped out the faction loyal to the shogunate. As a result, the Chōshū were now unified in its policy to overthrow the shogunate. The Second Chōshū expedition by the Shogunate was commenced in response to this act. Everyone believed that Chōshū was now done for, but Chōshū, perhaps having had a taste of success, decided to appoint Takasugi as their naval commander. Takasugi then took command of the navy and won a great victory against the shogunate fleet. This battle's victory undermined the authority of the shogunate, which in turn contributed to the Meiji Restoration.\n\n\nHowever, Takasugi, who had been afflicted by illness, died of pulmonary tuberculosis without seeing imperial rule fully restored.\n\"Ah, I was just getting to the best part, too.\""],

It's fun to swing around.\n\n\nDuring normal combat, he wields his homemade Molotov cocktails and shamisen blades, and on top of that he even summons and manipulates a miniature prototype model called Prototype Arahabaki, demonstrating his reckless fighting style. If anything, my style looks more like a Rider than an Archer, but I'm not the kind of guy to fit the mold, so you should appreciate that about me.\n\n\nThis combat style was derived from events in the Meiji Restoration City Saitama singularity, but due to the nature of his peculiar Noble Phantasm and dramatic fate, it became engraved into Takasugi's Spirit Origin."],

This is an Anti-Army Noble Phantasm that strengthens its allies by endowing them with the necessary skills and equipment according to the war’s situation. It is a difficult Noble Phantasm to use, as it requires managing the finer details such as determining the enemy’s weaknesses, selecting the necessary equipment, and adjusting one’s skills. Essentially, it is a supporting Noble Phantasm that enhances its allies.\n\n\nIn its fully unleashed version, in other words the ace up his sleeve, it is possible for Takasugi to summon the strongest army he can imagine and utilize it temporarily.\n\n\nDue to the effects of the Noble Phantasm described above, it is possible to summon or select a large number of soldiers with Servant-class combat power with the best equipment, skills and abilities needed to suit the battlefield, as well as operate and strengthen said soldiers as a unit. However, once unleashed, it is a self-destructive Noble Phantasm that rapidly wears down Takasugi’s Spirit Origin and places a tremendous burden on him, so its operational time is short and it becomes difficult to activate again.\n\n\nIncidentally, the equipment and weapons to be enhanced will become the latest armaments available in that era, so its effects may vary. For example, the Stone Age will summon stone axes, and the early modern era will summon bombers, thus making this a romantic Noble Phantasm that you never know will be strong or weak."],
